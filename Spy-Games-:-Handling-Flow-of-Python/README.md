### Learnings from the project

 How to implement intermediate concept of Python such as lambda functions, file handling etc.


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 Since the information were in files, I had to use file handling operations to retrive them and process them


### Challenges faced

 Some concepts like lambda functions and list comprehension were confusing at first, but using the materials and Cheat Sheets, I was able to implement them properly


### Additional pointers

 Having hands-on practice on concepts like these are very useful to get familiar with them
